# WN24-RMP

<img src="asset/rmp.jpg" height=50/>

Rate My Professor is the biggest platform for student giving feedbacks on professors. It is used by students of different universities around the world. Using the data scraped from the RMP website, we can conduct a lot of interesting analysis that provides insights on our University of Michigan. This project will be mainly split into two parts. The first part will be analyzing the RMP dataset and trying to find answers to some intriguing questions, such as which department of UM has the best overall student feedback on professors. The second part we will dive into conducting sentiment analysis on RMP comments. We will use student comments and labels to train a model for predict a professorâ€™s RMP rating, based on the comments that he receives. We will benchmark our performance and compare our model with a AWS model that trained on the same dataset and analyze areas of potential improvements.

## Technologies

We will be using Python and libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, and scikit-learn. To ensure a consistent
working environment among the team and encourage collaboration, we will write our code on Google Colab. See setup [here](./guide/colab.md)

## Dataset

In the [data](./data) folder there are four web-scraped csv files, cleaned and processed ready to go. (by Casper Guo)
